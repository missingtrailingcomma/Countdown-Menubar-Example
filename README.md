# Countdown-Menubar-Example
# [.\__.]

##About
Countdown app living in menubar. Tested on OS X 10.11.2.

I start this project simply because I need something to remind myself that something is going to happen on winter 2016 and I want to get my notes app done with full Markdown support before them:
> For now Alternote expands some of Markdown entities to rich text. Weâ€™re planning to support full Markdown syntax, including code snippets and tables, in version 2.0 (expected to release in Winter 2016).

##Built with great Open Source softwares
* [menubar](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar)
* [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron)
